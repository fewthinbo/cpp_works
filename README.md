# Thread-Safe Data Management System

A modern C++ implementation of a thread-safe data management system with advanced locking mechanisms and queue operations.

## Core Features
- Thread-safe data access with read/write lock support
- Smart mutex management with deadlock prevention
- Queued operation system
- Automatic thread tracking and lock management
- Configurable timeout and cleanup mechanisms

## Architecture

### Lock System
- Supports both read and write locks
- Automatic lock acquisition and release
- Built-in deadlock prevention
- Lock conversion capabilities (read to write)

### Thread Safety Features
- Mutex tracking per thread
- Lock order management
- Automatic resource cleanup
- Thread-safe data wrapper

## Build Requirements
- Modern C++ compiler with C++17 support
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Support for atomic operations and threading

## Usage
The system provides interfaces for:
- Thread-safe data access
- Queued operations
- Lock management
- Data wrapper utilities
